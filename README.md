# ☃Advent of Code 2023☃

In this repository, I will upload all the problems I manage to solve in Advent of Code 2023. It's all done for fun, so I'll tackle some in Python and others in C++, depending on how I feel that day. Fun is the key! 🐒


## Usage

Each day indicates in the folder name the language used to solve the problem. For the python days, python3 have been used. To execute the python solutions:

```console
python3 <scriptName>.py
```

For the C++ solutions, Clang 14 for C++20 have been used. First, you need to compile and the run the executable. 

```console
clang++ -std=c++20 <sourceCodeName>.cpp -o <executableName>
./executableName
```
